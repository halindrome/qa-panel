# Roadmap and current state

Written as a handoff. Everything below is verified, not assumed; where something is
unverified it says so.

---

## Where this came from

The plugin was extracted from a private, single-organisation implementation that lived as a
**copied-per-project** skill: a full copy of `SKILL.md` (1748 lines), `preflight.sh` (1027
lines), the test suite and five helper scripts, plus two agent definitions, duplicated into
every repo that used it. That duplication was the problem being solved.

A separate, older sibling (`pr-qa`, GitHub) also existed with the same shape and less
capability. Folding it in is Phase 3 below.

---

## Current state — working, local only

Eight commits on `main` in `~/Sources/claude-qa-manager`. **Never pushed.** That was
deliberate: the repo is public-destined and git history is permanent, so the scrub had to be
complete *before* the first push rather than fixed in a later commit.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `test/preflight.test.sh` | 160 passed / 0 failed |
| `test/init.test.sh` | 21 passed / 0 failed |
| `test/no-private-identifiers.sh` | clean (and verified non-vacuous) |
| `claude plugin validate .` | passes |
| Inventory | Skills (2) `qa-init`, `qa-cycle`; Agents (2) `qa-manager`, `qa-reviewer` |
| `/qa-cycle` on-invoke cost | ~15.6k tokens (was ~41.9k; ~15.1k before the forge seam) |
| Always-on cost | ~682 tokens for the whole plugin |

### Commits

1. `dcd8810` scaffold — Apache-2.0, manifests, case studies, config model, CI, scrub guard
2. `ab3c67d` preflight + its suite, decoupled from the host repo layout
3. `85f3e59` skill + both agents; suite goes fully green
4. `2ff68da` `init` — environment check, project config, verified token setup
5. `885c6b1` spine split — 41.9k → 15.1k on-invoke
6. `34471a2` CLAUDE.md + this file, as a session handoff
7. `3dcb9c1` rename `qa-round` → `qa-cycle`; aliases dropped
8. the forge seam (Phase 3) — see `git log` for the hash

## Decisions already made — do not relitigate

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| Ship as a **Claude Code plugin** | Verified by spike: a conventional `agents/` dir is discovered with **no manifest key**. The design depends on `AskUserQuestion` gating human decisions and `SubagentStart` injection — abstracting that away would gut it. Claude-specific by choice. **Amended 2026-09-04:** this entry also said "the design depends on Agent subagents nesting two deep". It no longer does — `lib/run-panel.sh` runs the lenses as `claude -p` subprocesses, so only the manager is a nested Agent. It remains a plugin either way, and it is now MORE Claude-specific, not less: the driver shells out to the `claude` CLI and depends on `--json-schema`, `--strict-mcp-config` and `--output-format json`. |
| **Apache-2.0**, public, personal work | Owner's call; stated explicitly. |
| Repo and plugin name **`qa-panel`** under `halindrome` (renamed 2026-10-08, 0.5.0) | `claude-qa-manager` became invalid: Claude Code 2.1.289's `plugin validate` reserves names starting `claude-`. Owner wanted `qa` first; `qa-panel` names the specialist-lens panel. Chosen over `qa-rounds`, `review-rounds`, `expert-qa-panel`, `halindrome-qa`. The user config dir moved to `~/.config/qa-panel/`; `lib/config-dir.sh` keeps using `~/.config/claude-qa-manager/` while only that exists, so no machine loses its token, and is the only place either path is spelled. History in this file and `CASE-STUDIES.md` keeps the old name. |
| **Build locally, push only when clean** | Public history is permanent. |
| **One skill with a forge adapter**, not two | The flows are identical; only the forge differs. Pays the spine cost once and lets `pr-qa` inherit preflight, the manager panel and proportionality, which it lacks. |
| **Targets are optional**; branches derive at runtime from the MR/PR | The older sibling's one genuinely better idea. A single repo needs zero config. |
| **Schema paths configurable, defaulting to empty**, gate reports `skipped:not-configured` | In the origin repo the gate was inert but *looked* like it ran. |
| Case studies **anonymised, not deleted** | Every number retained; only identifiers dropped. They are the empirical backbone of the design and make it more credible, not less. |
| Spine + `references/` split | The 42k on-invoke cost was indefensible; ~15k of it described work preflight already performs. |
| Skill named **`qa-cycle`**, not `qa-round` | One invocation drives the whole cycle: Step 3D loops into round N+1, Step 3E approves, Step 4 prints "QA Cycle Complete". `round` is the unit *inside* the skill, not the skill. Renamed together with the project config path (`.claude/skills/qa-cycle/config.json`), the scratch prefix (`/tmp/qa-cycle-*`) and the test seam (`QA_CYCLE_SCRATCH_ROOT`). |
| **No aliases** — `/qa-cycle` only | The forge is detected from the git remote, so `/mr-qa` vs `/pr-qa` encodes nothing the plugin does not already know. `/pr-qa` would also collide with the older sibling skill still installed at `~/.config/claude-code/skills/pr-qa/`. Two extra always-on skill descriptions bought nothing. |
| **Schema MRs need a human approval, and the MR author counts** (decided 2026-09-28) | Owner's policy: a human must sign off, not a second person. The gate excludes only the QA agent. Counting the author is safe only because `forge_approve` refuses an empty token, so the tool cannot approve under the author's identity (§self-approval-fallback). No config switch for a two-person rule; add one when an adopter needs it. |

## What is left

### Phase 3 — forge adapter and absorbing pr-qa  *(DONE — code complete, unexercised)*

1. ✅ **Forge seam extracted.** `lib/forge.sh` (dispatcher + shared URL parsing) with
   `lib/forge-gitlab.sh` / `lib/forge-github.sh` behind it. Contract: `forge_cli`,
   `forge_auth_user`, `forge_project_slug`, `forge_project_enc`, `forge_view_mr`,
   `forge_approvers`, `forge_notes`, `forge_post_note`, `forge_approve`,
   `forge_unapprove`. **The normalized shape is GitLab's**, so the GitLab backend is a
   near-passthrough and GitHub carries the whole mapping.
2. ✅ **Second-opinion shims collapsed** — `--mr` and `--pr` are the same flag in both
   `do-reviewer.sh` and `qwen-reviewer.sh`. That was ~all of the sibling's 18-line delta.
3. ✅ **GitHub SAST ported** to `lib/fetch-sast-github.sh`; the GitLab one is now
   `lib/fetch-sast-gitlab.sh`. Preflight picks `lib/fetch-sast-${forge}.sh`. They share an
   interface and an **output contract** (the classifier phrases), not an implementation.
4. ~~**Aliases.**~~ Dropped — see the decisions table. `/qa-cycle` is the only entry point.
5. The sibling still lives at `~/.config/claude-code/skills/pr-qa/` — source material for
   the GitHub paths. **It has no `preflight.sh`**; it is the older design.

**Things the port changed on purpose, not by accident:**

- The sibling's GitHub SAST helper emitted its "checks still running" warning as a
  subsection **after** the `## NEW SAST findings` heading, so preflight's classifier
  scored a still-running scan as `clean` — and Step 3E writes that into a permanent
  approval comment. Every "did not run" state is now decided and exited **before** the
  findings heading.
- `forge_approvers` (GitLab) reads `/approvals` first and `/approval_state` second.
  `approval.md` had always documented that `/approval_state` lags after a human approves,
  but preflight's seeding used only the lagging endpoint.
- GitHub keeps the full review history, so `forge_approvers` reduces to each reviewer's
  **latest** state — otherwise a withdrawn approval still reads as an approval.
- New `forge` config key + `QA_FORGE` env override, because host sniffing cannot see a
  self-hosted GitLab or a GitHub Enterprise instance. Unresolvable is **exit 2**, never a
  silent default to GitLab.

**JSON keys renamed** (`gitlab_project` → `project`, `gitlab_project_enc` → `project_enc`)
and `forge` / `forge_cli` added.

### The pattern behind two confirmed bugs found in one day (and one retraction)

**A behavioural requirement stated once as prose, with no mechanism and no test, does
not happen.** Two confirmed instances, found 2026-09-03, both previously believed fine —
plus a third that was reported and then retracted, which is recorded here rather than
deleted because the retraction is the more useful lesson:

| requirement | how it was stated | what happened |
|---|---|---|
| rewrite `status` as each lens returns | `qa-manager.md` §1.5, marked **MANDATORY** | never happened; counter read `0/N` for the whole fan-out |
| `qa_introduced_blocking` | named in an output schema, consumed in SKILL.md | never *defined* anywhere; over-counted in 62 of 262 rounds |
| ~~`run_in_background: true` dropped~~ | ~~one parenthetical~~ | **RETRACTED — this was an analysis error, not a bug. See below.** |

Both were fixed by removing the prose requirement rather than strengthening it —
`lib/lens-landed.sh` does the write in one call and counts from disk; the counter got a
stated computation, and `lib/round-return.sh` now computes it outright.

**The retracted third row, and why it is worth keeping visible.** It was reported here
as a bug on the strength of `run_in_background` being absent from the `tool_input`
recorded in session transcripts across several rounds. That was wrong: those agents
*were* backgrounded. Their tool results read `Async agent launched successfully` and
carry an `output_file` pointer the caller is explicitly forbidden to read. The flag is
simply not always persisted in the recorded input, and **an absent field was read as a
value** — the exact failure this document warns about everywhere else, committed while
documenting it.

Two things survive the retraction. First, `run_in_background: true` matters more than
the original parenthetical suggested, and for a different reason than the retraction
assumed: it is **context isolation**, not responsiveness. A backgrounded agent hands
back a stub; a foreground one would land the entire round in the caller's context, which
is the manager's whole reason to exist. SKILL.md now says that. Second, the analysis
lesson: when a field's absence is the evidence, confirm what absence *means* in that
source before building on it. Transcript metadata is not a schema.

The general lesson for anything added here still stands on the two confirmed rows: if a
rule matters, give it a script, a computed value, or a test. Emphasis is not enforcement.

**And enforcement is available at this level — that is settled, further down this file.**
`PreToolUse` hooks DO fire inside a subagent (measured again on 2026-09-03: 747 hook
firings across 78 subagent transcripts, 196 of them blocks, plus subagents adding
`# cmm-exempt` markers precisely because they are being gated). So the two confirmed rows
are not evidence that a rule of this kind *cannot* be enforced; they are evidence it was
never attempted. The plugin ships no hooks at all — already an open item below.

Two cautions before reaching for one. A shipped `PreToolUse` hook fires in every session
of every adopter, so it must exit immediately on anything outside its concern. And the
deadlock recorded below is real: a hook that orders a lens to route through `ctx_execute`
while that lens cannot load `ctx_execute` leaves it with `Read` alone. Any gate this
project ships must fail **open**.

A worked example of what a gate would buy, from the same day: the manager passed
`model: sonnet` to three lenses with config empty and an explicit instruction to pass no
override. A `PreToolUse:Agent` gate rejecting an unauthorized `model` on a `qa-reviewer`
spawn would have stopped that; no amount of prose did.

### Spike result — `claude -p` lenses beat `Agent` lenses on every measured axis

Run 2026-09-04 against a lens panel from a real round (3 lenses, a 649-line diff, a
CMM-indexed repo) versus a `claude -p` probe in the same repo on the same machine.

**1. Tool reachability — `-p` wins, and not narrowly.** The `-p` session loaded the CMM
graph tools and **called `search_graph` successfully, 12 rows returned**. The three Agent
lenses, given a mandate reading *"The tools below ARE available in your session; use them
for all code work. Do NOT default to Read + grep"*, loaded the same tools and called them
**zero times** — falling back to `ctx_execute` and `Bash`. So the objection that `-p` would
lose code navigation is backwards: `-p` is the arm that used it.

Two separate defects surfaced underneath that, both worth fixing regardless of
architecture:
- ~~the injected mandate names **bare** tool names (`search_graph`), which `ToolSearch`
  cannot resolve — every lens burns a round-trip discovering it needs
  `mcp__codebase-memory-mcp__search_graph`.~~ **FIXED 2026-09-04.** The bootstrap line now
  builds its `select:` list from the regime preflight actually detected. Fixing it turned
  up a second, unreported defect in the same line: the example listed the five **CMM** tool
  names *unconditionally*, so a ctx-only session was told to load five tools it did not
  have and none of the ones it did.
  The ctx prefix is **not knowable from the probe** — a plugin install is
  `mcp__plugin_context-mode_context-mode__`, a direct server registration is
  `mcp__context-mode__` — so both are emitted. An unmatched name in a `select:` list costs
  nothing; a missing one costs the round-trip the fix exists to remove.
- after loading them, the lenses used them anyway not at all. A lens reporting
  `navigation: cmm+ctx` while making zero CMM calls is a self-report contradicted by its
  own tool log — the same class as every other failure in the section above.

**2. Unattended completion — pass.** `exit 0`, `stop_reason: end_turn`,
`terminal_reason: completed`, 9.5s API / 13s wall, no hang and no interactive prompt. A
denied tool call was recorded structurally in `permission_denials[]` **and the run
continued to completion**. A denial is data, not a wedge. Note also that the denial came
from the project's own `PreToolUse` enforcer — hooks apply to `-p` sessions, so the
enforcement layer is not lost by moving off `Agent`.

**3. Cost — startup is modest; parity on real work is NOT yet proven.** The probe cost
$0.25 over 4 turns. **Startup is turn-1 `cache_creation + cache_read`: `-p` ~50k against an
Agent lens's ~64k.** (An earlier version of this paragraph read "~107k cache-read startup".
That was wrong twice — the figure was the *cumulative* re-read across all four turns, not
turn 1, and it was compared against nothing. Corrected 2026-09-04.) So `-p` starts
*cheaper*, and either way startup is ~2% of the round: the Agent arm burned **8.4M
cache-read for three lenses** doing the actual work. But the probe did trivial work where a real lens runs
15–21 tool calls over a full diff, so this is *not* apples to apples and review-quality
parity remains untested. That is the one open risk.

**Bonus: `--output-format json` gives observability the Agent path does not.**
`permission_denials`, `subagent_stats` (spawned / refused / killed, by reason),
`total_cost_usd`, `num_turns`, `duration_ms`, and **`modelUsage` naming the model actually
used** — which answers the model-recording problem in the entry below directly, with no
hook required.

**Correction to the plan's Phase 2: `config/lens-mcp.json` cannot be a shipped static
file.** `--mcp-config` takes server *launch commands*, and those are machine-local — on this
machine CMM is `{"codebase-memory-mcp":{"command":"~/.local/bin/codebase-memory-mcp"}}`
in `~/.config/claude-code/.mcp.json`, and context-mode is a plugin with no entry there at
all. A file shipped in `config/` would name a path that exists on one machine. Preflight
must **generate** the lens MCP config into `$QA_SCRATCH` from the operator's own
registration, keeping only the two servers. That preserves the property the plan wanted —
the lens tool surface is a property of the plugin, not of the operator's connector list —
without hardcoding anyone's filesystem. Deferred until the driver exists; nothing reads the
file before then.

**Consequence.** A driver script invoking lenses via `claude -p` makes most of the proposed
enforcement unnecessary rather than built: the model becomes an argument, output filenames
belong to the driver, the progress counter is written after each `wait`, `failed_lenses` is
an exit code, and a wedged lens is a watchdog kill. Before committing, run **one real lens
prompt** through `-p` and compare its findings against the Agent arm's — mechanism is
proven, equivalence is not.

This contradicted the do-not-relitigate entry justifying plugin packaging partly because
"the design depends on Agent subagents nesting two deep." **That entry is now amended**
(2026-09-04, with the driver landed); it remains a plugin either way.

### Phase 1 parity result (2026-09-04) — 3 of 4 criteria pass; `-p` reviews BETTER

The spike proved mechanism, not review quality; the plan made that a stop-the-plan gate.
It has now been run. **The driver architecture is not stopped.**

One recovered lens prompt (`contract-security`, round 2 of PR #89, a 35-file /
+3624/-75 diff) replayed through `claude -p` and compared against the Agent arm's
own artifacts. Criteria were **fixed in writing before the result was seen**, because
the baseline made one of them awkward (below) and choosing a reading afterwards is the
rationalisation principle 4 exists to prevent.

| criterion | Agent arm | `claude -p` | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. valid JSON in the lens schema | fenced block, parses | **markdown round-note, no JSON at all** | **FAIL** |
| 2. findings overlap, no serious finding lost | 3 findings, 24 contract rows | **7 findings, 39 contract rows** | **PASS** |
| 3. actually *called* CMM | **0 CMM calls** | 1 `search_graph` | **PASS** |
| 4. wall clock within ~2x | 435s | 603s (1.39x) | **PASS** |

Cost and shape: `-p` **19 turns / 1.61M cache-read / $4.42**; the Agent lens **45 turns /
4.73M cache-read**. Fewer than half the turns and ~3x less cache-read, for more than twice
the findings. `stop_reason: end_turn`, `permission_denials: 0`, no hang; hooks fired in the
`-p` session (13 emissions), confirming the enforcement layer is not lost by leaving `Agent`.

**Criterion 1 is a real defect and its cause is known.** `--agent claude-qa-manager:qa-reviewer`
loads `agents/qa-reviewer.md`, which prescribes a `## Header` markdown round-note; that
**system** prompt beat the **user** prompt's "Return a fenced ```json block". The Agent arm
had the identical conflict and JSON won — so the format is not stable, it is a coin toss
that the two paths happen to resolve differently. The driver owns the invocation and must
force the format outright rather than ask twice and hope. **This is a required Phase 3 fix,
not a reason to stop:** it is an output-format failure, not a review-quality one.

**Criterion 3, and an honest retraction of the spike's headline.** The spike claimed "`-p`
is the arm that used it" and that reads stronger than the evidence now supports. On a real
prompt `-p` made **one** graph call, and its `Navigation: cmm+ctx` line — accurate, and
matching its tool log — explains that `get_code_snippet`/`trace_path` were loaded and
judged unnecessary for a diff of bash hooks with no cross-file call graph. That is exactly
the "loading them and judging the graph unnecessary is a correct call" case the mandate
names, not a triumph. The criterion was applied **as the plan writes it (absolute, not
parity)**: had it been read as parity, 0-vs-0 would have been scored a tie.

**Why the review was better, concretely.** The `-p` arm ran the hooks under test with
crafted stdin and cited return codes: an unbalanced apostrophe in a comment silently
disarming the `# ctx-truncate-ok` escape hatch; `>` inside `(( a > b ))` read as a
redirect *in both* the hook and the analyser. It also strictly superseded the Agent arm's
one unmatched minor — where the Agent said the suggested replacement was "unpasteable",
`-p` showed it is a **semantically different program** (`if (( a )); then` runs its branch
whenever `a` is non-zero). No Agent finding was lost.

**Confounds controlled** (all verified from artifacts, not assumed):

- **Model.** The Agent lens ran `claude-opus-5` on all 45 turns, read from its transcript.
  `-p` `modelUsage` confirms `claude-opus-5` for the work — plus `claude-fable-5-1` for
  107k input tokens of helper traffic, which the `Agent` path gives no way to see at all.
- **System prompt.** The recovered 11k prompt is only the lens's *user* prompt. `--agent`
  supplies the rest; bare `-p` would not have had the output schema. **Add `--agent` and
  `--plugin-dir` to the "verified invocation" — the plan's flag set omits both.**
- **Tree state.** Not reproducible in place: PR #89 has merged, so today's
  `origin/develop..HEAD` yields 5 files / -174. The reflog pins develop at review time to
  `7bfbd5d`, and `7bfbd5d..b9cc572` reproduces preflight's recorded diffstat exactly.
  Replayed in a clone with develop rewound.
- **Prompt.** Byte-identical (11,153 bytes) except one line, the repo root. Proven by
  `diff`, not asserted.
- **The mandate handicap is deliberate.** The recovered prompt carries the OLD bare-name
  mandate. The Agent baseline is historical and cannot be re-run, so splicing the fixed
  mandate into the replay would have confounded it the other way. Both arms carry the same
  handicap; the runtime is the only variable.
- **One asymmetry favours `-p` and is not a test artifact.** `--strict-mcp-config` gave it
  exactly the two pinned servers; the Agent arm took whatever the session had. That is a
  *design property* of the driver path, and it is why the property is worth having.
  Incidentally it settles the prefix question: under `--mcp-config` the ctx tools resolve
  as `mcp__context-mode__`, the direct form.

### Phase 3 result (2026-09-04) — `lib/run-panel.sh` landed and wired

The panel now runs as `claude -p` subprocesses. Three commits, each safe on a live
tree until the last: the driver + schema + catalog; preflight generating
`lens-mcp.json`; then the wiring.

**Gate 0 settled the one open question first.** `--json-schema` was known to beat a
system prompt that said "Never emit JSON", but only on a single trivial turn — it was
unverified whether it constrains the final message or short-circuits the tool turns a
real lens needs. One run with `--agent claude-qa-manager:qa-reviewer --plugin-dir …
--json-schema …` on a prompt requiring real file reads: **`num_turns=4`,
`.structured_output` present and schema-shaped**, $0.28, 47s, `stop_reason: tool_use`,
`rc=0`. It constrains the answer, not the work. That closes Phase 1's only failing
criterion.

What the driver owns, each mapped to a live failure: the model is an argument (no
invented Sonnet), filenames belong to the driver (no seven names for one artifact),
the counter is refreshed per landing by `lens-landed.sh` counting files on disk (no
`0/N` latch), a failed lens is `failed-<name>.json` (no remembered list), a wedged
lens is a TERM-then-KILL watchdog (previously undetectable except by a stall
heuristic), and `panel-models.json` records the model each lens **actually** ran as
from its own `modelUsage` — which closes the "silently inherit a weak model" item
below to the extent that it is now *observable*, with no hook.

Three defects were found by the suite rather than by a live round, and each is a
one-line lesson:

1. **`lens-*.json` is a load-bearing glob**, not just a filename convention.
   `round-return.sh:101` derives `failed_lenses` from it. The run record was briefly
   called `lens-models-actual.json` and reported as a landed lens named
   "models-actual".
2. **`agents/qa-manager.md` told the manager to write `{"lens":X,"failed":true}` into
   `lens-<name>.json` "so the gap is visible."** Against that same derivation it did
   the opposite — it made a dead lens count as landed. Deleted.
3. **Replacing code means carrying the reasons it was written that way.** The
   driver's first tree snapshot was `git status --porcelain`, dropping the HEAD and
   branch lines the manager's version had — and the line above them explains that a
   clean branch switch leaves porcelain byte-identical.

Not done here, deliberately: the merge step stays a manager judgement call (it is
merge/dedupe, which is what a model is for), and the Phase 5 gate scripts are
untouched. `qa-cycle` on-invoke held at 16.3k.

### First live round (2026-09-04) — FAILED, and it was worth more than a pass

Round 1, `rest-api` target, 4 lenses. **All four died before doing any work**, and the
two defects behind it are the useful part.

**1. The driver deleted the config it was about to pass.** Preflight wrote
`lens-mcp.json`; `run-panel.sh`'s round hygiene was `rm -f "$S"/lens-*.json`, which
matches it; every lens then started with `--mcp-config` pointing at a path that no
longer existed and exited 1 on startup. `preflight.json` still said
`lens_mcp_state: ok` — correctly, because preflight *had* written the file.

This is the **third** appearance of one root cause: `lens-*.json` is a load-bearing
namespace (`lens-landed.sh` counts it for the progress denominator, `round-return.sh`
derives `failed_lenses` from it, the driver clears it between rounds). The first two
were caught by the suite — `lens-models-actual.json` reporting as a landed lens, and
a documented rule telling the manager to write `{"lens":X,"failed":true}` into it. The
third shipped because the fixture had no `lens-mcp.json` and the fake `claude` ignores
`--mcp-config`, so nothing in 581 tests could see it. Two fixes, both applied: the file
is `panel-mcp.json` now (driver-owned non-findings files live under `panel-*`), and the
cleanup deletes **by name** from the catalog rather than by glob.

**2. `jq` on a zero-byte file exits 0 with no output**, so `jq … || printf null` never
fires. Four failed lenses left four empty envelopes and `panel-models.json` was written
as `{"contract-security": , …}` — not JSON, in the file whose only job is to record
what actually ran. The guard has to be on the output, not the exit code.

**What worked, and is the reason this round is evidence rather than a mess:** every
failure was recorded as a distinct `failed-<lens>.json` with its state and stderr; the
tree snapshots bracketed the panel and matched; `status` reached `0/4 done` rather than
latching; and the manager refused to render a clean round — its note opens *"This round
FAILED to review the MR. No review of the change was performed, and nothing below
should be read as a clean result,"* names the harness as the cause, and states that an
absent Contract Verification table is not a passing one. That is invariant 2 holding
under a total panel failure, which no test had exercised.

**The live round was the red run.** Both fixes have regression tests
(`the mcp config survives the driver's round hygiene`, `panel-models.json is valid JSON
with every lens dead`), and the failure they pin is the one that actually happened.
Suite 584 → 590.

### Rounds 1 and 2 on the driver (2026-09-04) — the architecture is proven

Same MR, immediately after the two fixes above. Round 1: **3 of 4 lenses landed**.
Round 2: **4 of 4, no failures**.

| | round 1 | round 2 |
|---|---|---|
| landed | 3/4 | 4/4 |
| navigation | `ctx` ×3 | `cmm+ctx` ×4 |
| model (from `modelUsage`) | `claude-opus-5[1m]` ×3 | `claude-opus-5[1m]` ×4 |
| cost | $8.96 | $13.96 |
| turns | 13/13/6 | 18/15/15/12 |
| tree mutated | no | no |

**The watchdog fired for real, and cleanly.** Round 1's `regression-edges` was killed
at 1200s — `fanout 11:45:51`, expected kill `12:05:51`, `failed-regression-edges.json`
written `12:05:52` with `{"state":"watchdog_killed","rc":143}`. `rc=143` is SIGTERM, so
the TERM-then-KILL path ran rather than a bare `kill -9`, and **no MCP server children
were orphaned** (every surviving server process had a live parent, none started inside
the lens's window). That was the one design choice a fake `claude` could not test. The
same lens completed in 421s in round 2, so the kill was a one-off wedge rather than a
systematically slow lens — which is why "wedged" needs to stay distinguishable.

**Round derivation and the trailer chain worked end to end.** Round 2 derived `round: 2`
from the posted round-1 heading and recovered a one-element `qa_fix_commits` from that
note's `QA-Fix-Commit` trailer, so attribution ran with real input
(`qa_introduced_blocking: 0`). This
is also where the `post_after_fixes` ordering earns itself: round 1 withheld its post
until fixes existed, because a note posted before the fix commits could never carry the
trailers the next round reads.

**A CORRECTION to the reading of round 1.** After round 1 this document was going to
record that the spike's headline had not reproduced — three lenses reporting `ctx`, not
`cmm`, with the graph reachable. Round 2 shows that was wrong: all four lenses used
`cmm+ctx` on the same MR. Round 1's `ctx` was a judgement call on a 147-line
single-pattern diff, exactly as its own note claimed. **The spike's finding stands**;
one round of `ctx` is not evidence against it, and treating it as such would have been
the "a lens reported X so X is true" error in reverse.

**What this closes in the open items below.** The "lens reviewers silently inherit a
weak session model" entry argues in part that the round-note model line "is prose the
manager writes from its own knowledge, not an observed value, so it is not evidence."
That half is now false: `panel-models.json` records the model each lens actually ran as,
taken from its `modelUsage`, and `references/round-note.md` reads the footer from it —
round 2's posted footer said `claude-opus-5[1m]` because the run record did. The
**observability** half of that item is closed. The **policy** half is untouched: invariant
6 still has no floor, and the plugin still cannot rank model strength, so an operator
whose default is a cheap model still gets a cheap panel — it is now merely *visible*
rather than invisible.

**Still open, and now sharper:** a watchdog-killed lens leaves **no diagnostic at all** —
round 1's `raw-regression-edges.json` was 0 bytes with empty stderr, so the only fact
recorded is "exceeded 1200s". Distinguishing a wedge from slow-but-working needs either
`--output-format stream-json` captured to disk or a `--max-budget-usd` ceiling. Neither
is built.

### Four more driver rounds (2026-09-06/07) — the panel is fine; its self-reporting was not

Read from the scratch dirs of every post-driver round. The **mechanism** is healthy:
19 of 19 lenses landed across four rounds, no `failed-*.json`, every `err-*.txt`
zero bytes, `permission_denials: 0` throughout (so the hook stack is not blocking
lenses), and every envelope schema-shaped. Cost ran $13.95–$19.45 per round.

Both defects found were in what the driver **says about itself**, and both reached
an MR. Fixed in `462d537`.

**The per-lens model was decided by a coin toss.** Every envelope carries two
`modelUsage` keys — the reviewer and Claude Code's own helper traffic — and the
primary was picked by `max_by(outputTokens)`. On a short lens that margin is noise:
the same lens, same config, went `helper 4043 / reviewer 3873` one round and
`helper 2368 / reviewer 2676` the next. The first of those published *"the
ui-styling lens ran on `<the helper model>`"* to a live MR. Input is the real
discriminator and is not close — the reviewer carries the cached round context
(cacheRead 333k–2.6M in all 14 envelopes measured), the helper reads no cache at
all — so ranking by total input picks the reviewer 14 of 14 by better than 10×.
The suite was green throughout because its fixture gave the reviewer 40 input
tokens, no cache fields, and the helper a 210-token output: every possible rule
picked the reviewer, so the case could not fail. **A stub more forgiving than
reality is a test that reports clean** — the second time that exact shape has been
caught in this repo.

Related, and worse: with the default config (`review_model=""`, `lens_models={}`)
no `--model` is passed, so `model_mismatch` has nothing to compare and can never
fire. The downgrade check was inert in the configuration everybody runs.
`panel-models.json` now carries `model_check: not-requested | requested`.

**The manager was writing `status` as prose, and three scripts laundered it.**
Three consecutive rounds, two sessions, two different tools:
`printf 'phase=lenses round=1 lenses=0/5\n' > .../status`. That is a faithful
rendering of what `qa-manager.md` §1.5 asked for — "set phase to merging, then
rendering, posting", "rewrite it at every transition", "use **Bash**" — which
never said the file is nine pipe-delimited fields. Field 1 (mr) became prose,
2–3 emptied, and by round end the counter and epoch start were zeroed, so the
statusline rendered `QA !phase=lenses round=1 lenses=0/5  r` at the operator.

It spread because `run-panel.sh`, `round-return.sh` and `lens-landed.sh` each
carried their own copy of the nine-field `printf`, each **copying fields 1–3
through from the file** — one bad write preserved by all three for the round.
`lib/set-phase.sh` is now the only writer: closed phase vocabulary, fields
rebuilt from `manager-brief.txt`, `done` counted from disk. A corrupted line now
**heals at the next transition** instead of degrading.

**Open, and the honest caveat:** the scripts heal the line, but nothing yet proves
the *manager stops writing prose* — §1.5 is still an instruction, and this repo's
whole thesis is that instructions fail. The first round whose manager reads the
new §1.5 is the test; check its subagent transcript for `set-phase.sh` calls and
zero `printf … > …/status`. Until then the claim is "scripts heal it", not
"the manager stopped".

### Smaller, independent items

- **Flag defaults in config; `.branchconfig.yaml` dropped (2026-10-02).** A `flags`
  block (`double`, `triple`, `reviewer`, `non_interactive`) defaults those flags;
  `--single` / `--interactive` undo a default for one run. Preflight validates and emits
  `flag_defaults`, warning `flag_default_ignored:<key>:<why>` for anything refused or
  unusable. `auto_approve` and `skip_contract_verification` are refused by design:
  approval must stay an explicit per-run act. `.branchconfig.yaml` was inherited from
  the private predecessor (`/mr-qa`); preflight read it only to report a `base_branch`
  that nothing used — sync, diff and panel all use the MR's target branch — so it and
  `targets.<name>.base_branch` are now ignored and `base_branch` is gone from
  `preflight.json`. Existing repos with the file keep working unchanged.

- **A note posted without a QA identity is labelled automated (2026-10-02).**
  `forge_post_note` puts an "Automated QA review" banner under the heading of any note it
  posts with an empty token. Previously the only signal was a template-rule `⚠ Posted
  with dev credentials` line at the bottom, gated on `QA_TOKEN_OK` — the flag that was
  true on !14 while three notes posted as the developer.

- **Second opinions are provider-neutral.** `--double`/`--triple`/`--reviewer=<name>`
  run `lib/llm-reviewer.sh` against reviewers configured in `second_opinion.reviewers`
  (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; none by default). Preflight resolves the list into
  `second-opinion.json` with `key_present`; keys are named by env var, never written.
  Replaces `do-reviewer.sh` / `qwen-reviewer.sh`, which never worked from the plugin:
  both called a `gemma-reviewer.sh` that was never committed, with an argument it
  rejects (`--mr` for `--pr`), and its bash-4 syntax and `quality` axis would have
  failed on macOS bash and misfiled findings in the merge. Not built: chunking a diff
  larger than a reviewer's `max_input_bytes` (it exits 5, named); tool use. A
  stronger direction is a mixed panel — individual lenses run by another provider's
  agent CLI behind a runner seam in `run-panel.sh`; spike it against a `claude -p`
  lens on a real round before building.

- **The contract no longer assumes Jira.** `contract.tracker` (`auto` | `jira` | `forge` |
  `none`; `auto` = jira when a `jira` MCP is registered, else forge) decides which
  references count and who fetches them. `forge` covers GitHub/GitLab issues (`#N`,
  `/issues/N`): preflight fetches them through the new `forge_view_issue` seam member
  into `contract.tickets_path`, so no model step sits between ticket and contract.
  `contract.ticket_pattern` and `contract.min_description_length` were shipped and
  never read; both are now honoured. A referenced ticket that cannot be fetched is
  `contract_source=ticket-unfetched`, not a plain synthesized contract. Not built: a
  generic MCP fetch tool (`contract.fetch_tool`) for Linear, Azure DevOps and the
  like — add it when someone needs it.

- **Sequential rounds are measured from the reviewer's transcript.** Rounds of
  `review_mode.sequential_max_lines_changed` (falling back to `tiny_mr_max_lines_changed`,
  50) changed lines or fewer run one Agent reviewer instead of a panel — 16 of the 41
  rounds over 2026-09-29..10-01, every one at or under 50 lines, so the split is the size
  rule working, not a fallback. No `--settings` hook reaches an Agent subagent, so
  `lib/sequential-tools-log.sh` derives `tools-sequential.jsonl` from its transcript:
  main transcript naming the scratch dir → qa-reviewer Agent call inside this round's
  fanout..tree-after window → the subagent whose `.meta.json` `toolUseId` matches.
  `lens-tools-summary.sh` runs it when no panel lens has a log and reports
  `review_path: panel|sequential|unknown`. First read (14 of 18 rounds linked): no
  `git show HEAD:`; line-range reads mostly in pre-routing rounds; most rounds have 1–2
  calls blocked by the target repo's own gates (the reviewer runs in the operator's
  session), almost all `sed -n`/`grep` on source.
- **Live lenses never got context-mode. FIXED 2026-09-30.**
  Every brief for a month read `lens_mcp_state=partial:context-mode`. Cause: context-mode
  was installed from a `directory`-source marketplace, which Claude Code runs from its
  `installLocation` and never from the plugin cache, and `_resolve_server` searched only
  the cache. `_server_from_directory_marketplace` now reads `known_marketplaces.json`,
  finds the plugin's relative `source` in that marketplace's `marketplace.json`, and
  resolves from there BEFORE the cache, since a cache copy of a directory plugin is a
  stale snapshot. The first measured round without it (webapp !2229 R1): 11 CMM calls,
  0 ctx, 31 Bash (19 of them `sed -n`/`awk NR` range reads), while every lens
  self-reported `navigation: cmm`. R2 with it: `lens_mcp_state=ok`, 16 ctx calls, but
  CMM fell to 3 — lenses ran `sed -n` ranges INSIDE `ctx_execute` and `Read` whole
  files, because the mandate offered ctx to "read large files". R2 is not a clean
  comparison: a round-1 fix commit landed in between.
- **Preflight refreshes the CMM index before the panel. AWAITING A MEASURED ROUND.**
  rest-api !809 (routing below in place): CMM did real work (10 `trace_path`, 17
  `search_code`, 7 `get_code_snippet`), but lenses still made 23 `git show HEAD:<file>`
  reads and 19 `awk NR`/`sed -n` slices. `agents/qa-reviewer.md` warns that the tree is
  shared, and nothing said whether the graph reflected this MR's HEAD; the freshness
  rule lived only in the fix mandate. Preflight now runs the CMM CLI's incremental
  `index_repository` after the sync (4s on a 100k-node monorepo; the CLI exits 0 on
  failure, so only `status == "indexed"` for this project counts) and records
  `tooling.cmm_index_state`. The mandate then says the graph is current and names
  `git show HEAD: | awk` as a dump, or says it may be stale. Measure: `git show HEAD:`
  count and line-range reads per lens.
- **Lens mandate routes source reading to the graph. MEASURED: partial.** When
  both servers are present, `tool-mandate.md` now gives ctx command output only (diffs,
  logs, test runs, non-code files) and names `sed -n` / `cat` / `awk 'NR…'` / `grep -n`
  on a source file as a dump whichever tool runs it, pointing to `get_code_snippet` /
  `search_code`. A ctx-only lens keeps "read large files". Measure with
  `lib/lens-tools-summary.sh`: CMM share and range reads inside `ctx_execute` input.
- **Lens tool use is measured by a per-lens hook log, not by transcripts.** Lenses
  run with `--no-session-persistence`, so neither `make measure` script in the
  enforcement stack can see them; the 330 `qa-reviewer` transcripts they do count
  are overwhelmingly the retired Agent-lens path. `run-panel.sh` passes each lens
  `--settings panel-hooks.json`, registering `lib/lens-tool-log.sh` on
  Pre/PostToolUse/PostToolUseFailure for that lens only, and it appends to
  `tools-<lens>.jsonl`. `lib/lens-tools-summary.sh <scratch>` reads the round: calls
  by class, failures, `no_result` (Pre with no Post: blocked or killed), the
  envelope's `permission_denials`, `ToolSearch` count, and tool time against span.
  Verified against a real `claude -p` (2.1.284): a success delivers Pre+Post, a
  failure Pre+PostToolUseFailure, a hook-blocked call Pre only; the hook fires under
  `--agent` + `--strict-mcp-config` alongside the target repo's own hooks.

- **Lens reviewers silently inherit a weak session model — invariant 6 has no
  floor. CLOSED 2026-09-18 by option 3 below.** A Haiku-session `/qa-cycle` ran its
  panel on Haiku, which is what finally forced it. Now: `review.model` ships as
  `opus` (there is no inherit state — `run-panel.sh` always passes `--model`);
  `review.allowed_models` (`["opus","fable"]`) is an enumerated allow-list, not a
  ranking; preflight exits 2 when any configured model, or an empty one, is off it;
  `run-panel.sh` refuses to spawn a lens whose brief model is off it
  (`model_not_allowed`) and discards the findings of one whose `modelUsage` is off it
  (`model_below_floor`); `panel-models.json` `model_check` is `allowed | below_floor`.
  The Agent-spawned paths — the manager, the sequential fallback, the fix-diff review —
  get `model: opus` in `agents/*.md` frontmatter, and the spine forbids passing a
  `model` parameter, which would override the pin. Two gaps remain: the Agent paths
  are pinned by frontmatter, not checked against a run record, so a caller that
  passes `model` anyway is not caught; and the main-loop orchestrator (Step 3B fixes,
  3E approval) still runs on the session model. The rest of this entry is the history.
  Invariant 6
  says never manage review cost by downgrading the model. The cycle never
  downgrades it *itself* — the letter of the rule — but `review.model` and
  `review.lens_models` ship **empty**, empty means "pass no override, inherit the
  session model", and so an operator whose everyday default is a cheaper model
  gets a full panel of that model, silently. The round then reports as an ordinary
  review: nothing in `preflight.json`, the manager's return, or any gate
  distinguishes it from a frontier-model round. That is invariant 2's shape
  applied to review quality — a precondition nobody checks reports as satisfied.

  The existing knobs do not close it. They are an opt-in **upgrade** path, and the
  plugin deliberately does not rank model strength, so it cannot detect that an
  inherited model is weaker than required.

  **AMENDED 2026-09-04 — the observability half is CLOSED; the policy half is not.**
  This entry used to end "and the round-note footer that names a model is prose the
  manager writes from its own knowledge, not an observed value, so it is not
  evidence." That is no longer true. `lib/run-panel.sh` writes
  `$QA_SCRATCH/panel-models.json` from each lens's `modelUsage` — the model the
  runtime actually billed, not a self-report — and `references/round-note.md` renders
  the footer from it. Verified on a live round: the posted footer read
  `claude-opus-5[1m]` because the run record did.
  So a weak-model round is now **visible** in an artifact and in the posted note.
  What remains open is the policy: there is still no floor, nothing *refuses* a round
  on a model too weak to review, and ranking model strength is still out of scope. The
  gap has moved from "nobody could tell" to "nobody stops it", which is a smaller and
  differently-shaped problem — and `lib/gate-approve.sh` is the natural place to act
  on it, since `panel-models.json` is now a checkable premise.

  Three directions, cheapest first:

  1. **Record what actually ran** — have each lens report the model it executed
     as, surfaced per lens in the manager's return and the round note. Observation,
     not policy: it cannot break a working setup and it produces the evidence
     needed to decide whether a gate is justified. **Do this one first.**
  2. **Warn on the empty case** — when both keys are empty, add a `warnings[]`
     entry saying the panel inherits the session model and invariant 6 is
     unenforced for this round.
  3. **A declared floor** — `review.min_model` / `require_model`, with preflight
     refusing to run when the resolved per-lens model is not in an allowed set.
     Must be an **enumerated allow-list**, never a strength ranking: this plugin
     does not rank models, and inventing an ordering here would be a second,
     drifting copy of a judgement that belongs to the operator.

  Same bug, second face: **subagent `effort`** (already listed below as its own
  item). A frontier model at minimum effort is a downgrade the cycle equally
  cannot see, and option 1 should record effort alongside the model.

  **OBSERVED LIVE, and worse than inheritance.** On a 649-line MR the manager
  passed `"model": "sonnet"` explicitly to all three lenses, with
  `review.model` and `review.lens_models` both empty and the brief correctly
  carrying them empty. `agents/qa-manager.md` says: use `lens_models[name]` if
  present, else `review_model` if non-empty, **else pass no `model` override at
  all**. It invented the downgrade. So the failure mode is not only the passive
  one this entry was filed for — a weak session model being inherited — but an
  active one, where the panel is downgraded against an explicit instruction and
  nothing in the round note, `preflight.json` or the verdict records that it
  happened. Whatever is built here must therefore **record the model each lens
  actually ran as** (option 1) rather than assume config describes reality;
  reading config would have reported "no override" for a round that ran entirely
  on Sonnet.

- **Stop the cycle reviewing its own work. DONE.** Measured across 76 `/qa-cycle`
  sessions, 21 projects, 267 round-records: **56% of rounds >= 2** carried at least
  one finding on code an earlier round of the same cycle wrote (0 of 106 round-1
  records did, by construction), and **36 rounds were pure fix noise** — zero blocking
  findings, a full panel spent on the previous round's own commit. The rate was flat
  across five weeks of tuning while blocking findings fell 94 → 50, which is what makes
  it structural rather than a tuning problem. Root cause: **Step 3B is the only
  unreviewed writer in the loop**, so a bad fix is first seen by a full panel a round
  later. Five changes, cheapest first:

  1. **`qa_introduced_blocking` now has a definition** (blocking-only), plus
     `qa_introduced_total` for the all-severity count. It previously had none anywhere —
     one appearance in the manager's output schema, one consumer — and the value
     exceeded `critical + major` in **62 of 262** rounds, including rounds with zero
     blocking findings and a count of 2–5. A number that can exceed its own denominator
     cannot gate anything, which is precisely why nothing gated on it.
  2. **`diminishing_returns` is computed**, at `qa_introduced_blocking >= max(2,
     ceil(blocking_total / 2))`. The lens-volunteered trigger it joins is effectively
     unreachable — attribution runs in the manager *after* lenses return and no lens is
     handed the fix commits — and it showed: 29 rounds met the criterion, 3 raised the
     decision. This changes the *trigger*, not the policy: findings on the cycle's own
     fixes are still reported and never acted on.
  3. **Minor + self-inflicted + in a test file is never offered as a fix** — it goes to
     the carry-forward ledger. `lib/attribute-findings.sh` stamps `in_test_file` from
     the **path only** (never content — §schema-drift's lesson), overridable via
     `review.test_path_pattern`. 60 of 200 measured self-inflicted findings were exactly
     this. A minor defect in code a customer executes is still asked about: the line is
     severity **plus location**, never "we wrote it, so skip it".
  4. **No round narration in the fix commit.** 35 findings a month, 6 blocking, were the
     previous round's own comments being found false by the next panel.
  5. **Step 3B.5 — a one-lens review of the fix diff, round >= 2**, before the note
     posts, with the push moved after it so a corrected fix amends the round's single
     commit. This is the lever for the only class a reviewer must catch: 91 of 199
     self-inflicted findings were runtime regressions, holding 21 of the 33 blocking
     ones. Same model as the panel (invariant 6) — the saving is width, not strength.

  Depth and the class breakdown: `skills/qa-cycle/references/fix-review.md`.

- **The manager never rewrites `status` as lenses return — progress is dead and
  the stall fuse measures the wrong thing. FIXED.** `lib/lens-landed.sh` now does the
  landing in one call and **counts `done` from the files on disk**, so there is no
  second step to omit and no number to misremember. The instruction it replaces was
  already marked MANDATORY, which is the point: bookkeeping a subagent must carry across
  a long context is not a mechanism, and the fix is to remove the bookkeeping rather
  than to word the instruction more forcefully. Original diagnosis below.

- **The manager never rewrites `status` as lenses return — progress is dead and
  the stall fuse measures the wrong thing. BUG, observed live.**
  `agents/qa-manager.md` §1.5 marks the per-return status rewrite MANDATORY. It
  does not happen. Observed on a live round (4 lenses, round 2): all four
  `lens-*.json` landed over a 100-second window while `status` sat unchanged at
  `0/4` for 521s and counting — last written 6m41s before the first lens even
  arrived.

  Two consequences, and the second is measurable:

  1. **No progress feedback for the entire fan-out.** `watch-round.sh` and the
     statusline read that counter, so they show `0/N` for a median 11m28s (p90
     22m). This is very likely a large part of why rounds *feel* far longer than
     they are — there is nothing to watch.
  2. **The stall fuse is applied to a statistic it was not tuned for.**
     `statusline-fragment.sh` computes staleness as `now - <newest status
     mtime>` against 1200s, and `config/defaults.json` states the premise
     plainly: *"The status file is rewritten when a lens RETURNS, so the
     legitimate silence between writes is however long your slowest lens
     takes."* With no rewrite, the silence is the whole fan-out instead.
     Across the 281 recorded rounds that actually fanned out:

     | statistic | median | p90 | max |
     |---|---|---|---|
     | max gap between lens returns (the documented model) | 399s | 771s | 3204s |
     | whole fan-out silence (what is actually measured) | 688s | 1317s | 3600s |

     **21 of 281 rounds (7%) would be flagged stalled while perfectly healthy** —
     their longest genuine silence was under the fuse, but the un-refreshed
     status file was not. p90 fan-out (1317s) already exceeds the 1200s default.

  `lib/record-timing.sh` is NOT affected and its 297 rows are sound: it reads
  `lens-*.json` mtimes directly, never the status file.

  Fix is in the manager, not the fuse — raising the threshold would paper over
  a progress signal that simply is not being emitted. Whether the rewrite is
  unreliable because it is prose in an agent definition rather than a
  deterministic step is the question worth answering first; if a subagent cannot
  be relied on to emit it, the writer should move somewhere that can.

- **End-of-cycle cost report — where the time and tokens actually went.** Rounds
  feel very long and nothing reports why. Measured over 1,497 real lens runs
  (180h of lens agent time) and 297 recorded rounds, the answer is that **it is
  inference, not local execution**:

  | inside a lens's 5.2-min median run | share |
  |---|---|
  | model think time | **80.0%** |
  | other tools (incl. `ToolSearch` schema loads) | 10.7% |
  | ctx sandbox | 8.2% |
  | bash — scripts, tests, git | **0.4%** |
  | file I/O | 0.4% |
  | CMM graph queries | 0.2% |

  Lens duration median 5.2m, p90 14.4m, max 47.6m; because the panel is parallel
  the fan-out phase is median 11m24s, p90 22m, max 60m. Cost is roughly 335k
  billable tokens per lens (16k output, 318k cache-creation) plus 3.3M cache
  reads — a 5-lens round ≈ 1.7M billable / 16.7M cache-read, a 3-round cycle
  ≈ 5M / 50M.

  **Consequence for anyone optimising this: do not tune the scripts.** Local
  execution is ~1% of lens time. The levers are panel width, `lens_tags`, and
  how much the lens is asked to read — the same levers invariant 6 already
  points at, and the reason it forbids reaching for a cheaper model instead.

  What exists: `lib/record-timing.sh` writes one row per round
  (`~/.config/claude-qa-manager/timings/<key>.tsv`) carrying only `max_gap` and
  `lens_phase`, for tuning the stall detector — and by its own header, nothing
  reads it. There is **no token accounting anywhere**, and no per-phase split
  (preflight / contract / SAST / fan-out / fix / verify / post).

  What a report needs, cheapest first: (1) per-lens duration and token usage —
  already present in each subagent transcript's `usage`, so this is a
  correlation problem (round → its subagent transcripts), not an instrumentation
  one; (2) phase stamps around the existing steps, which is a few `date +%s`
  writes into `$QA_SCRATCH`; (3) a reporter at Step 4 reading both. Give it a
  did-not-run state per invariant 2 — a cycle whose timing file is missing must
  say so, not print a confident zero.

- **Every `gh` call is pinned to the resolved slug. DONE.** `preflight.sh` exports
  `GH_REPO` (respecting a caller's existing value) once the forge is resolved as
  GitHub. A `gh` invocation that omits `--repo` otherwise falls back to gh's own
  remote resolution, which **in a fork checkout prefers the parent repository** —
  so PR #N of a fork silently returns upstream's PR #N. `forge_view_mr` is exactly
  such a call, and it supplies the branch names and diff range the entire round is
  built on. Observed live: preflight resolved the fork slug correctly and then
  reported a different, already-merged PR by another author, every field internally
  consistent; only a failed branch checkout stopped the panel from reviewing an
  unrelated diff. With a PR number valid on both sides and a branch that happened
  to check out, the round would have come back clean on the wrong change — the
  invariant-2 shape, since nothing in the output said "wrong repository".
  Exported rather than threaded through `forge_view_mr`'s signature because
  `(<dir> <n>)` is the cross-forge contract in `lib/forge.sh`, shared with the
  GitLab backend; `GH_REPO` is ignored by `glab`, so this is inert on a GitLab run.
  Locked by `preflight.test.sh`, which asserts the slug the **stubbed CLI actually
  saw** rather than the presence of the export line — an assertion on the source
  text would pass even if the export were placed after the first forge call.
- **Model override — upward, not downward. DONE; its "inherit" default and "not
  enforced" clauses are SUPERSEDED 2026-09-18** by the `allowed_models` floor (see the
  invariant-6 entry above). `config/defaults.json`
  `review.model` (global) and `review.lens_models` (per lens name, wins over
  `review.model`) let an operator spend a stronger model than the session's on
  the panel or on individual lenses; empty/absent means every lens inherits the
  session model, unchanged from before this existed. Resolved in `preflight.sh`
  into the manager brief (`review_model`, `lens_models`); `agents/qa-manager.md`
  resolves per-lens and passes it to the `Agent` spawn. Not runtime-enforced
  upward: this plugin does not rank model strength, so a config that names a
  weaker model than the session's silently defeats invariant 6 — that is a
  config-authoring responsibility. A model the runtime cannot resolve fails the
  spawn like any other lens failure (retried once, then `failed_lenses`) rather
  than silently falling back to the session model.
- **Consider `effort` on the agent definitions — upward, not downward.** Subagent
  frontmatter supports `effort: low|medium|high|xhigh|max` ("Overrides the session effort
  level. Default: inherits from session"; available levels depend on the model). Nothing
  in this plugin sets it, so both agents inherit. The interesting move is *raising* it on
  `qa-reviewer`: invariant 6 says never manage review cost by downgrading the model, and
  effort is the same lever class, so the same reasoning makes a harder-thinking reviewer a
  legitimate quality lever. Unresolved before changing anything: it multiplies across up
  to six concurrent lenses; a level the session's model does not support needs a defined
  fallback rather than a silent one; and `qa-manager` is coordination rather than
  analysis, so it probably wants a different answer from the lenses. Worth an A/B on one
  MR — same target, same panel width — rather than a guess.
  Related fields on the same page that this plugin also does not use, and which may be
  worth more than effort: `skills` (preloads full skill content at subagent startup — the
  tool-mandate injection currently does that by hand), `isolation: worktree` (a private
  checkout per lens, which is the containment answer to the shared-tree problem in
  CASE-STUDIES §lens-contamination, and would make mutation testing safe rather than
  forbidden), `maxTurns`, and `background`.
  Also from that page: **extended thinking is NOT per-subagent** — it inherits from the
  session, with no per-subagent setting, and before Claude Code v2.1.198 subagents ran
  with it disabled regardless. Any measured lens behaviour predating that version was
  measured under different conditions.
- **`docs/INSTALL.md`** — not written. `README.md` currently carries install steps inline
  and does **not** link to it, so this is optional rather than a dangling link.
- **Trim `Step 3A.1`** in the spine. It is the largest kept block; its "why a manager
  subagent" rationale and cost caveats belong in `references/design-notes.md`. The forge
  seam pushed on-invoke from ~15.1k to **~15.6k** (a `forge` row in the field table, the
  seam-sourcing in the post-note block), so the ~15k target is now missed by more than it
  was. This is the identified way back under it.
- **`config/schema.json`** — a JSON Schema for project config, validated on load. Planned,
  not built.
- **`lib/gemma-reviewer.sh`** was NOT migrated (493 lines, present in the source tree) —
  and **both shipped second-opinion helpers are shims over it**, so `--reviewer=do` and
  `--reviewer=qwen-local` cannot work as shipped. They fail loudly ("gemma-reviewer.sh not
  found or not executable"), not silently, but they are documented in
  `references/sequential-and-multimodel.md` as if they work. Either migrate
  `gemma-reviewer.sh` (it holds the actual chat-completions logic both shims delegate to)
  or delete both shims and the docs that reference them. **Do not publish ANY version with
  this unresolved** — it is a documented feature that is guaranteed to fail on first use.
  This gate is about publishing, not about the version string: it was once worded "do not
  ship 0.1.0", which a routine bump to 0.2.0 would have satisfied without fixing anything.
  Local installs from the directory-source marketplace are not publishing and are not gated.
- **The two second-opinion READMEs were not migrated** (`qwen-reviewer.README.md`,
  `gemma-reviewer.README.md` in the source tree). Nothing links to them, so there is no
  dangling reference — but `--reviewer=qwen-local` is documented in
  `references/sequential-and-multimodel.md` with no setup instructions behind it.
- **`init.sh config` only handles the schema question.** Monorepo `targets` must be written
  by hand afterwards. Extending it to prompt for targets would be welcome.
- **Consider a `hooks/` component.** The plugin manifest supports hooks and ships none.

### Field defects from the first end-to-end run (2026-08-03)

The round *has* now been executed end-to-end from this repo — GitLab, `rest-api` MR !712,
a 214-line diff, two rounds, six lenses each, both clean, ending in a QA-agent approval.
The prediction in *Known gaps* held exactly: the first live run is where the latent path
and config bugs surfaced. Four did. **D1 is a correctness defect in the approval gate and
should be fixed before anyone else runs a cycle**; the rest are ordered by severity after
it. Rationale for D1 is written up as `CASE-STUDIES.md` §self-approval-fallback.

Each item below states how it was observed, so a session can reproduce rather than trust.

1. **D1 — an approval can fall back to the developer (author) identity, silently.**
   `forge_approve()` (`lib/forge-gitlab.sh:113`) passes `${3:-}` to `_glab`, so an empty
   token means "use the default identity". On a self-authored MR that turns *no QA
   approval* into *author approved* — it passes an approvals check and reads as review.
   The empty token arose because `references/approval.md`'s Step 3E snippet uses
   `$QA_TOKEN` while **nothing in the main loop assigns it**: `qa_token_env` /
   `qa_token_file` are emitted only into the manager brief (`lib/preflight.sh:1380-1381`),
   and Step 3E does not run in the manager. `preflight.json` carries `qa_token_ok` and
   `qa_auth_user` but not the names to resolve from.
   *Observed:* approve reported success; `forge_approvers` then returned the **author's**
   username. Nothing in preflight, the seam, or the skill reported an error.
   *Fix, three parts:* (a) `forge_approve` / `forge_unapprove` **refuse an empty token**
   (non-zero, no call) on both forges — and say at the definition why `forge_post_note`
   deliberately does *not*, so the asymmetry survives future tidying; (b) publish
   `qa_token_env` / `qa_token_file` in `preflight.json` and have Step 3E read them instead
   of re-deriving; (c) after approving, assert the approver equals `expected_qa_user` and
   is not `mr_author`, failing the step otherwise.
   *Acceptance:* a preflight fixture with no token available must make the approval step
   exit non-zero with the MR unapproved — today it exits zero with the MR approved by the
   author. Worth a `test/` case, since this is the one defect that manufactures a false
   audit record.

2. **D2 — the forge seam's documented argument form disagrees with three of its four
   implementations.** `lib/forge.sh:35-39` documents `forge_approvers`, `forge_post_note`,
   `forge_approve` and `forge_unapprove` as all taking `<enc>` (the URL-encoded slug). Only
   `forge_approvers` accepts it — it re-normalizes via `forge_project_enc` at
   `lib/forge-gitlab.sh:100`. The other three pass the argument to `glab -R`, which requires
   `OWNER/REPO` and rejects `owner%2Frepo`.
   *Observed:* `forge_unapprove owner%2Frepo <n>` — the documented form — failed with
   `Expected the "[HOST/]OWNER/[NAMESPACE/]REPO" format`. SKILL.md's own
   samples pass the *unencoded* `$PROJECT`, so the code is right and the header comment is
   wrong.
   *Fix:* either normalize in all four (cheapest: call `forge_project_enc` / a matching
   `forge_project_slug` at the top of each) or correct the header to state which form each
   takes. Normalizing is better — a seam whose members disagree on their argument form is a
   trap for exactly the caller who read the docs.

3. **D3 — lens subagents cannot load the CMM / `ctx_*` tooling they are mandated to use.**
   All six lenses reported it in **both** rounds. Where those tools are *deferred* in the
   host session, they must be loaded with `ToolSearch` before first use — and inside a
   `qa-reviewer` subagent `ToolSearch` returns **"No matching deferred tools found"**. So
   the deferred-tool registry is not reachable from a subagent at all, and the mandate in
   `agents/qa-reviewer.md` (and the CMM preamble the host injects) describes tooling the
   lens cannot obtain.
   *Observed:* round 1 lenses fell back to `Read` + standalone `perl` probes; round 2
   explicitly instructed each lens to call `ToolSearch` first, and that mitigation **failed
   the same way** — so this is not fixable by prompt wording.
   *Impact:* reviews still executed real experiments and produced grounded findings, so
   this degrades quality rather than breaking it. But the mandate currently *claims* a
   navigation regime the lens does not have, which is its own kind of false record.

   **RE-VERIFIED DIRECTLY, 2026-08-03 — fixed.** The field report was confirmed from
   inside a live `qa-reviewer`, after restarting the context-mode MCP server so a server
   fault could be ruled out. From the subagent: calling `search_graph` directly returns
   `No such tool available`; `ToolSearch(select:…)` for four CMM/ctx tools returns
   `No matching deferred tools found`; no `mcp__*` tool is present at startup despite
   `tools: [… mcp__*]` in the frontmatter. It is a platform limit, not a wording problem.

   Two things the original note did not have, both from that run:
   - **The root cause is in `preflight.sh`, not the agent prompt.** `_probe_registered`
     answers *"is this MCP server installed"*, and the mandate turned that into *"the
     tools below ARE available in your session"*. Those are different claims, and the
     second is false for a subagent. That is invariant #2 — an absent capability
     reporting as present — aimed at the lens. It also explains why the round-2
     mitigation could never work: the `ToolSearch` instruction was added for an earlier,
     genuinely different failure (main-loop reviewers that never fetched deferred tools),
     where it is correct.
   - **Reachability depends on `review_mode`, which preflight already knows.** A lens on
     the *manager* path is a subagent and cannot reach them; a reviewer on the
     *sequential* path runs in the main loop and can. Same probe, opposite truth — so the
     mandate is now rendered after `REVIEW_MODE` is set and states the truth for the path
     it is going into. Both paths now require a closing
     `Navigation: <regime>` disclosure line, and the manager records it as
     `lens_navigation` (a missing line is `unknown`, never assumed good) and reports any
     degraded lens in `blocking_summary`. Pinned by tests asserting the manager mandate
     does **not** claim availability and does **not** order a `ToolSearch`, while the
     sequential one keeps both.

   *Still open:* a lens on the manager path has no graph tooling at all, so this is
   mitigated and disclosed, not solved. Recovering it needs one of: the host resolving
   queries and passing results in, or the `skills:` frontmatter preload (untested). Do
   that only if a real round produces a finding a graph query would have caught.

   **Two further platform facts from the same run, both contradicting things this
   project's notes assert.** Neither is fixed; both are worth knowing before trusting a
   subagent's environment:
   - **`PreToolUse` hooks DO fire inside a subagent.** `.claude/rules/cmm-rules.md` and
     `cmm-agent-preamble.md` both state they do not, citing Claude Code issue #34692. In
     the test, `ctx-execute-enforcer.sh` blocked the lens's `grep -c …` `Bash` call with
     its full message, and allowed `git status --short` — i.e. it fired, selectively, via
     its exemption list. The combination is worse than either fact alone: a hook can
     order a lens to route through `ctx_execute` while the lens is unable to load
     `ctx_execute`. That is a deadlock, not a degradation. (This hook is local to this
     repo and unshipped, but any adopter installing context-mode the same way inherits
     the shape.) The remedy belongs in the hook, not here: it should **fail open** when
     `ctx_execute` is unreachable, since a reviewer with no `ctx_execute` and no `Bash`
     is left with `Read` alone.

     Note the clause that is false is *only* the subagent one. `agent-cmm-gate.sh`
     (`PreToolUse:Agent`) behaved exactly as documented on a main-thread `Agent` call,
     blocking a probe that omitted the preamble.
   - **A wildcard in a `tools:` grant can match nothing.** The lens had
     `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, ToolSearch, mcp__*]` and came up with no `mcp__*`
     tool at all. `Grep`/`Glob` were also absent, but that is **not** attributable to the
     grant — they are absent from the host session too, so the lens inherited their
     absence. `ToolSearch` DID survive the grant and was callable; it simply returned
     `No matching deferred tools found`. Working hypothesis, not yet isolated: a grant
     resolves against *concretely loaded* tools, so `mcp__*` matches nothing while the
     MCP tools are deferred, where a bare `*` (or no `tools:` key at all) would not
     narrow anything and so cannot drop them.

     This is why `qa-manager` and `pr-qa-reviewer` never hit it: neither declares
     `tools:`, so both get the full set — the breakage was specific to the one agent type
     carrying a restrictive list, not to subagents in general.

     **Fixed by deleting the `tools:` line from `agents/qa-reviewer.md`.** The grant was
     not buying read-only enforcement either: it left `Bash` in place, so the tree was
     always writable. Read-only is now stated as a rule in the prompt and enforced by the
     manager's before/after tree check (§1.4), which was always the real guard. Both
     files that described the old grant were corrected — do not re-add it.

4. **D4 — on the manager path, the round note cannot carry its own `QA-Fix-Commit`
   trailers.** SKILL.md Step 3C requires one trailer per fix commit, and the next round's
   attribution reads them back (`qa_fix_commits`). But Step 3B (fixes) precedes Step 3C
   (post) only on the *sequential* path. With `post_note=true` the manager posts at panel
   completion — before the operator has triaged findings, so before any fix commit exists.
   *Observed:* both rounds posted a clean note with no trailers; the operator had to post a
   separate addendum carrying `QA-Fix-Commit:` so round 2's `qa_fix_commits` would populate.
   It did populate, which confirms the read-back works — but only because of a manual step
   the skill never asks for.
   *Fix:* either have the manager return `note_path` unposted when the round produced
   actionable findings (let main post after 3B), or define an addendum step so the trailer
   requirement is satisfied by something the skill actually prescribes. A cycle whose
   attribution depends on an undocumented operator habit will lose it.

**One thing that worked and is worth keeping:** round derivation from posted notes survived
a fresh process across four separate invocations, and `qa_fix_commits` correctly recovered
the round-1 commit from its trailer. The round-2 panel then used it to attribute findings to
QA-introduced code rather than to the MR — the mechanism did what it was designed for.

### Field defects from the first GitHub / fork run (2026-08-10)

The first run on **GitHub** — and the first on a **fork** — was `halindrome/jcode` PR #1, a
390-line Rust/TypeScript/Python/shell diff, two rounds, three lenses each, ending in a
deliberate `diminishing_returns`-shaped stop rather than an approval. One defect surfaced,
and it is the most dangerous class this plugin has produced so far: **the round reviewed the
wrong pull request and said nothing.** Written up as `CASE-STUDIES.md` §wrong-repo.

1. **D9 — `forge_view_mr` ignores the resolved project slug, so a fork checkout reviews the
   upstream PR of the same number.** `lib/forge-github.sh:57-61` calls
   `gh pr view "$n" --json …` with **no `--repo`**, so `gh` falls back to its own remote
   resolution — which in a fork prefers the **parent** repository. Every other `forge_*`
   function in that file takes the plain `owner/repo` slug as `$1` and interpolates it into
   an explicit `repos/${slug}/…` API path; this one function is the outlier, and it is the
   one that decides *which change the entire round reviews*.
   *Observed:* in a checkout whose `origin` is `1jehuang/jcode` and whose `fork` remote is
   `halindrome/jcode`, `preflight.sh 1 fork` correctly resolved
   `project=halindrome/jcode` from the target's `remote` key, then emitted
   `mr_title="Add auto-update system for release builds"`, `mr_author=1jehuang`,
   `source_branch=feature/auto-update`, `state=closed` — upstream's PR #1, a different,
   closed PR by another author. The run survived only by luck: sync then failed at
   `git checkout feature/auto-update` (exit 4, hard stop) because that branch did not exist
   locally. **Had a same-named branch existed, a full panel would have reviewed the wrong
   diff and posted a note about it under the operator's identity.** Workaround for the whole
   cycle was `GH_REPO=halindrome/jcode` in front of every invocation.
   *Fix, pick one:* (a) narrowest — `forge_view_mr` takes the slug like its siblings and
   passes `--repo "$slug"`; costs a signature change at both implementations and the one
   caller. (b) belt-and-braces — `preflight.sh` exports `GH_REPO="$FORGE_PROJECT"` once,
   immediately after Step 0.3 resolves the slug (it is resolved *before* the MR fetch, so
   the ordering already works). `GH_REPO` does not disturb the explicit `repos/${slug}/…`
   API paths. (a) is the real fix — the seam's contract is "every function takes the slug"
   and this one silently does not — and (b) is worth doing anyway as a backstop.
   *Acceptance:* a fixture whose `origin` and target `remote` point at different slugs must
   make `forge_view_mr` return the PR from the **target's** remote. Today it returns the
   `origin` one. This belongs in `test/` — it is the second defect after D1 that
   manufactures a false record rather than merely failing.
   *Also worth adding regardless of which fix lands:* preflight already knows
   `source_branch` and could assert that the fetched PR's head branch exists on the target
   remote before proceeding. That check would have converted this from a silent
   wrong-PR review into a clear error, independently of the root cause.

### Field defect from the MR !735 run (2026-08-14) — FIXED

1. **D10 — every Agent spawn used a bare `subagent_type`, which stops resolving the moment
   a sibling plugin claims the name.** *Observed:* round 1 on GitLab MR !735
   (`plc-thresholds`, `apps/rest-api` target, sequential path) returned
   `Agent type 'qa-reviewer' not found. Available agents: … claude-qa-manager:qa-manager,
   claude-qa-manager:qa-reviewer, … mr-qa-manager, mr-qa-reviewer, … pr-qa-reviewer`.
   The machine had three sibling QA agents installed, so the bare name was ambiguous.
   *Why it is worth recording even though it was survivable:* the round only continued
   because the model re-read the error's own list and retried with the qualified name.
   Nothing in this plugin told it to, so the recovery was luck of the runtime, not a
   designed fallback — and on the manager path the failure lands inside a **subagent**
   fanning out 3-6 lenses, where a retry is neither guaranteed nor visible. A silent
   partial panel is a round that reviews less than it claims.
   *Fixed:* `f66a174` — all three spawn sites carry the `claude-qa-manager:` prefix
   (`SKILL.md` main→manager, `agents/qa-manager.md` manager→lenses,
   `references/sequential-and-multimodel.md` sequential reviewer).
   *Acceptance:* `grep -rn subagent_type skills/ agents/` returns three hits, all
   qualified, none bare. Worth a test-suite assertion — it is a grep, and D10 is the
   second defect (after D1) where the plugin's own text named something that did not
   resolve at runtime.
   *Not fixed, and deliberately:* nothing verifies at runtime that the qualified name
   resolves. A spawn failure is still a hard stop; it is just no longer a predictable one.

### Before the first push

1. All three suites green + `claude plugin validate .`.
2. `bash test/no-private-identifiers.sh` clean — the gate on going public.
3. `gh repo create halindrome/claude-qa-manager --public --source . --push` (authed as
   `halindrome`, a **user** account, with `repo` + `workflow` scopes — verified).
4. Confirm CI goes green on ubuntu **and** macOS. macOS ships bash 3.2 and BSD `sed`/`grep`;
   both axes have broken this code before, which is why the matrix exists.
5. Only then `claude plugin marketplace add halindrome/claude-qa-manager`.

## Known gaps and honest caveats

- ~~**The round has never been executed end-to-end from this repo.**~~ **Done, 2026-08-03**
  — GitLab, `rest-api` MR !712: `init.sh check`/`config`, two full rounds (six lenses each,
  both clean), fix commits, SAST wait-gate, and a QA-agent approval. The prediction here was
  right: the first live run was where the latent bugs surfaced, and it produced four —
  including one that **approved an MR as its own author**. See *Field defects from the first
  end-to-end run* above; D1 should be fixed before the next cycle. Still unexercised on this
  path: the deferred-findings exit, the dirty-re-round revocation (`Step 3B.6`), the
  sequential/tiny-MR route, `--double`/`--triple`, and any schema-change MR (the gate ran and
  correctly reported *no* change, so the armed branch is still untested).
- **The GitHub path has never touched a real GitHub PR.** `forge-github.sh` and
  `fetch-sast-github.sh` are exercised only against the suite's `gh` stub, which emits
  GitHub's native shape so the normalization is genuinely under test — but a stub cannot
  catch an endpoint that moved, a scope a token lacks, or a field GitHub renamed. Treat
  every GitHub-specific claim in this file as **code-complete, not verified**. The GitLab
  path at least inherits several hundred real review rounds; the GitHub path inherits the
  sibling's mileage only where the logic was ported unchanged, and several pieces were
  deliberately not (see Phase 3's "changed on purpose").
- **`review_mode`, lens selection and proportionality tiers are inherited unchanged** from
  an implementation tuned against one organisation's repos. The thresholds (`round >= 3`
  escalation, severity caps, 6-lens ceiling) are reasoned from a small number of real
  cycles, not tuned broadly.
- **An MR sourced from a protected branch gets no automated QA** — preflight exits 4 and the
  round does not run. This is the deliberate safe failure; supporting it properly needs a
  three-dot diff range threaded through every consumer and the fix step gated to
  report-only. Its own change, its own review.
- **The 6 tests that were permanently red in the source repo are gone, not fixed.** They
  asserted one organisation's target registry, which is now project config, so the block was
  re-aimed at what this repo ships (defaults and examples must parse and may only use known
  lens tags). If that trade reads wrong, it is worth revisiting.
- **Second-opinion reviewers are unverified here.** `do-reviewer.sh` and `qwen-reviewer.sh`
  were migrated but never invoked in this repo; they need `DO_LLM_API_KEY` / a local LM
  Studio respectively.

---

## Decided 2026-09-09 — the cycle stops waiting on things it should not wait on

**Both pre-panel prompts are gone on their unambiguous path.** The round-1
*"Skip Contract Verification?"* AskUserQuestion is deleted and replaced by
`--skip-contract-verification`; Step 0.5 now auto-selects a mentioned ticket when exactly
one resolves, and asks only when two or more do. The operator reported never once answering
"yes, skip" — a question whose answer is always the same, or is derivable from the data, is
not a gate, it is a stall, and it cost five minutes of walked-away time per cycle. A
timeout-and-proceed was considered and is not available: `AskUserQuestion` has no timeout
and blocks the turn, so the only real choice is ask or don't ask. Every gate whose answer a
human actually supplies is untouched (schema, deletions, approval, fixes on someone else's
branch, diminishing returns). Auto-selection is recorded as
`contract_source=jira:X (auto: sole mentioned candidate)` so it is visible, not silent.

**The verify run is bounded, by a wrapper rather than a smarter detector.** `detect-verify.sh`
proves a test entry point *exists*; nothing proved it *terminates*, and Step 3B handed the
raw command to the model to run by hand — so a `scripts.test` resolving to a watcher hung
the round with nothing to kill it. `lib/run-verify.sh` now closes stdin, exports `CI=1`, and
kills the **process group** on timeout. Sniffing the recipe was rejected again per
`design-notes.md:36`; the bound is uniform and catches hangs a pattern list would miss.
`timeout` is a distinct non-pass state, like `none-found`.

**The bound is learned per target.** After three completed runs the limit drops to 5× the
median (floored at 60s, capped by `timeout_seconds`), so a 20-second suite that wedges is
caught in about a minute rather than burning the ceiling. Timeouts are deliberately **not**
recorded: a gate that widened itself every time it fired would eventually bound nothing.
Under three samples the JSON says `limit_source: configured` and never invents a baseline.

Four things this work found that are worth not relearning:

1. **A watchdog must not sleep in a child.** `sh -c 'sleep N; kill …'` leaks the `sleep`
   when the shell is killed — ~1 in 8 runs, adopted by init, still holding the caller's
   stdout, so a later `$(run-verify …)` blocks for the remainder of the limit. Under
   mutation the suite did not fail, it *hung for 32 minutes*. Perl sleeps and signals in one
   process now.
2. **Never infer "timed out" from an exit-code range.** `rc >= 128` reports a segfaulting
   suite (139) as a timeout, turning a crash the round must see into "ran out of time". The
   state comes from a watchdog sentinel file.
3. **Two guards for one thing means neither is tested.** Mutation runs showed a redundant
   `// 900` and a redundant kill could each be deleted with no test failing. Collapsed to
   one covered line each — defence in depth that nothing exercises is a blind spot wearing a
   safety vest.
4. **A baseline may only aggregate comparable runs.** Found on the first live round to use
   the helper, not by any test. A round runs a narrow red-first check on one test file and
   then the full suite, seconds apart, against the same target: 22s and (say) 400s. Pooled,
   the narrow run sets the bound for the suite, which is then killed and reported
   unverified — and it is a one-way ratchet, because timeouts are deliberately not recorded,
   so the suite never contributes a counter-sample and the bound only drifts down. Every
   fixture had used a single command shape per timings file, which is why the suite stayed
   green through the defect.

   **Settled: only the declared `verify.command` is measured.** Checksum-keying the timings
   file per command was tried first and rejected — it is a heuristic that buckets every
   ad-hoc invocation, and each bucket then learns independently, so a command run twice ever
   never reaches the sample minimum. The config already declares which command is the gate,
   so `run-verify.sh` takes `--canonical-command` and records nothing else. One file per
   target, no heuristic.

   **Settled: the derivation constants are config, not literals.** `multiplier`, `window`,
   `floor_seconds` and `min_samples` live in `verify.baseline`, resolved per-target like
   every other verify key, with `min_samples: 0` opting out. They were first chosen against
   one project's suite, and a generic driver must not ship one project's calibration as
   though it were a law — which is what hardcoding them did. `/qa-init` reports the
   effective policy and does not write it: the values are defaults a project rarely needs
   to change, and prompting for them would rebuild the walk-away-and-wait stall this same
   change set removed from `/qa-cycle`.

   A side benefit worth keeping: `run-verify.sh --from-preflight <preflight.json>` reads
   the command, bound, timings path and policy itself, so `verify.command` never passes
   through a shell line the model has to re-quote. That removed four arguments from the
   spine as well as an error class.
5. **The config merge is recursive, not shallow.** `preflight.sh:121` is
   `jq -s '.[0] * .[1] * .[2]'` and jq's `*` merges objects deeply, so a project overriding
   `verify.command` still inherits the shipped `verify.timeout_seconds`. `CLAUDE.md` claimed
   the opposite until today, and a guard was written for a failure that could not happen.
   Check with `jq -n '{a:{x:1,y:2}} * {a:{x:9}}'` before relying on either belief.
