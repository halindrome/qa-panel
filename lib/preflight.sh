# preflight.sh — deterministic pre-QA resolution for /qa-cycle.
#
# Collapses the entire mechanical preamble that the /qa-cycle skill previously
# walked the model through one LLM turn at a time (Step 0 arg/target/base-branch
# resolution, Step 0.25 QA-token verify, Step 0.4 scratch dir, Step 0.7 approval
# seed, Step 2 branch sync, Step 2.5 SAST driver,
# Step 3A.0.1 schema scan) into ONE script that emits a single JSON blob the
# orchestrator reads in one shot.
#
# Usage:  preflight.sh <MR_NUMBER> <TARGET>
# Output: writes $QA_SCRATCH/preflight.json (and echoes it to stdout).
#         side effects: writes $QA_SCRATCH/schema-change.md and
#         $QA_SCRATCH/sast.md (the canonical filenames the skill expects).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success — preflight.json emitted, state is clean to proceed. May still
#      carry warnings[] the orchestrator must surface.
#   2  usage / config error THE OPERATOR CAN FIX (bad args, unknown target,
#      missing tooling, unresolvable remote URL).
#   3  SOFT gate — the sync MERGE ITSELF deleted files net-negative ("cut from a
#      stale base"). Measured over PRE_MERGE_HEAD..HEAD, i.e. what the sync did —
#      NOT over base..HEAD, which is the MR's own authored change and would fire
#      on any legitimately deletion-heavy MR. The gate is evaluated BEFORE the
#      push, and trips it: the merge is left LOCAL and unpushed so the operator
#      can still decide. preflight.json IS emitted with
#      warnings=["unexpected_deletions"], sync.reason explaining it, and
#      sync.deleted_files listing the casualties. The orchestrator turns this
#      into an AskUserQuestion confirm rather than a hard abort.
#      KNOWN LIMIT: the predicate cannot tell "the base legitimately deleted
#      these files" from "this branch is stale and the merge reverts my work" —
#      which is exactly why it asks a human instead of aborting.
#   4  HARD stop — the sync could not be performed safely. Covers: fetch / merge /
#      push non-zero, a merge conflict or dirty index, a FAILED CHECKOUT of the
#      source branch, a dirty working tree blocking that checkout, and a
#      PROTECTED source branch. preflight.json is emitted with sync.failed=true
#      (sync.reason carries which) for diagnostics, but NO QA round may run. This
#      is the "throw if the sync fails" contract.
#      KNOWN LIMITATION: an MR sourced FROM a protected branch (the repo's
#      merge-up pattern) is refused, so it gets no automated QA — review it by
#      hand. Refusing is the SAFE failure. Letting the round proceed read-only was
#      tried and produced two holes: Step 3C pushed fix commits straight to the
#      protected branch, and the panel diffed an unrelated (often empty) HEAD and
#      certified an MR it never read. Supporting it properly needs an exported
#      three-dot diff range, consumers that read it instead of hardcoding ..HEAD,
#      and a report-only Step 3C — its own MR, its own QA.
#   5  INTERNAL failure — an invariant in THIS script broke (jq build failed, the
#      emitted JSON failed its own shape assertion). Not the operator's fault and
#      not fixable by re-running: it is a bug here. Distinct from 2 so it cannot
#      hide behind "usage error".
#
# The only things the orchestrator still does as LLM/interactive turns after
# this are: contract resolution (a Jira MCP fetch when the tracker is jira, synthesis, and an AskUserQuestion
# only when two or more mentioned tickets resolve), any SAST wait-gate prompt,
# and the review panel.

# nothing they control was wrong, and hid genuine bugs in this script behind a

  # Schema-change scan — a PATH check against the configured schema file(s).
  #
  # The schema is whatever `schema.files` names: the file(s) a provisioner reads to

  # if not, it did not. That is the whole rule.
  #
  # DO NOT reintroduce DDL content scanning. An earlier version also globbed `sql/`
  # and `*.sql` and grepped the diff CONTENT for DDL keywords. It matched DDL in any
  # non-.md file — test fixtures, code comments, even test LABELS — so changes
  # touching zero SQL were reported as schema changes and armed the human-approval
  # gate over a printf string. Defending it took a self-trip guard, a regex
  # extractor and behavioural probes, which produced five review findings of their
  # own and protected nothing. A path check cannot match a comment: the false
  # positive is impossible by construction rather than guarded against.
  # See docs/CASE-STUDIES.md #schema-drift.
  #
  # PATH FRAME. `git diff` runs in $TARGET_ABS, so the paths it prints are
  # relative to the TARGET repo root — for a submodule target that is
  # `db/template.sql`, not `apps/api/db/template.sql`. A config naming the
  # superproject-relative path therefore could NEVER match, and the gate reported
  # `detected=false, state=checked` on an MR that did change the schema: invariant
  # 2 exactly (an absent check reporting as a pass), on the one gate that arms
  # mandatory human approval. `(^|/)…$` only tolerates EXTRA LEADING segments, so
  # it forgives a short config against a long path and not the reverse.
  #
  # So strip the target's own path prefix before matching. After stripping, one
  # pattern covers both frames: config `apps/api/db/template.sql` with target
  # `apps/api` becomes `db/template.sql`, which matches the submodule's
  # `db/template.sql` AND a root target's `apps/api/db/template.sql`. Both spellings
  # of the config now work, which is the point — an operator should not have to know
  # which cwd git was invoked from to configure this gate.
  #
  # COVERAGE NOTE: the incident this gate exists for was a CODE-ONLY dependency —
  # code reading a column that never reached the schema file. This detector does not
  # and should not catch that; it is the `schema-propagation` LENS's job, enabled by
  # a target's `schema` lens_tag, independent of this flag.
  #
  # --no-renames is load-bearing. With rename detection ON, a similarity-detected
  # rename prints ONLY the destination, so `git mv template.sql schema.sql` plus an
  # appended ALTER emits just `schema.sql` — the schema file changes, the match

# variable that round 3 then removed, net zero across two rounds; round 3's fix
# added a 230-line test play, and round 4 was 11/14 findings ABOUT THAT TEST
# PLAY. By round 4 the panel was reviewing its own output, the diff had grown
# 9x, and the shipped behaviour had been correct since round 2. No individual
# finding was wrong — the aggregate was worthless.

# decisions on eligibility but is given none of the inputs, so when main forgot to
# pass it, the manager could never raise either decision and the hands-free path

# not the subagent boundary. `agents/qa-reviewer.md` used to declare
# `tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, ToolSearch, mcp__*]`, and the `mcp__*` wildcard
# matched NOTHING because MCP tools are deferred rather than concretely loaded —
# so the lens came up with no MCP tools at all and `ToolSearch` answered "No
# matching deferred tools found". That looked exactly like a platform limit and
# was briefly documented as one here. Deleting the grant fixed it: on the next
# round every lens loaded ctx_* via ToolSearch and made 5-14 real calls, and four
# lenses resolved the CMM schemas too — all of them on the MANAGER path, i.e. as
# subagents. Agents with no `tools:` key (qa-manager, pr-qa-reviewer) never had
# the problem. Do not re-add a restrictive `tools:` list to a reviewer.
#
# So the mandate does NOT branch on review_mode: reachability is the same on both
# paths. It stays rendered here, after REVIEW_MODE is set, only because nothing
# needs it earlier.
#
# What is still true, and why the disclosure line at the end is not optional:
# `_probe_registered` answers "is this MCP server INSTALLED", which is not the
# same question as "did the reviewer use it". Only the lens can answer that, so
# it is required to say. Invariant #2 — an absent check must never report as a
# pass — applies to the navigation regime as much as to any gate.

#
# target_abs is the LAST field and is what scopes a round to a project. The
# scratch directory name is a hash and cannot be reversed, so without this a
# renderer can only pick "the most recently written round" — and two concurrent
# cycles in different repos then each display the other's progress, alternating
# as they write. Carrying the path in the line keeps the match to one cheap

# directory. Diagnosing a live round meant reading agent timers in the UI and
# guessing. The file's MTIME is as load-bearing as its contents -- it is what
# makes a stall visible, because a stalled round stops touching it while a
# healthy one keeps counting up.
#
# Deliberately pre-formatted and single-line: a statusline renderer reads it on
# every repaint, so it must cost one read and no parsing of preflight.json.
# Field 9 is the project's own stall tolerance, resolved HERE because the renderer

# ⚠ REGRESSION GUARD — expected_qa_user / qa_token_env / qa_token_file.
#
# These three are emitted into the JSON body below (search `qa_token_file:`). That
# emission is UNCOMMITTED as of 2026-08-03: it exists in the working tree, not in
# HEAD. Commit it. If it is ever dropped again, the failure is silent — jq accepts
# an unreferenced --arg without complaint, so removing the body line leaves the
# --arg above looking correct and emits nothing.
#
# This is not hypothetical; it is why the guard is here. On the pre-fix version the
# keys reached only the MANAGER BRIEF, while skills/qa-cycle/SKILL.md's field table
# listed them as preflight.json fields and told the main loop "Read these; never
# re-derive them from config." A session that FOLLOWED that instruction looked in
# preflight.json, found the keys absent, and was left to guess precisely the value
# the instruction exists to stop it guessing.
#
# It recurred on observability-stack !14 (2026-08-03, running the pre-fix version):
# the main loop guessed `~/.config/claude-qa-manager/qa-token` instead of the real
# `qa-agent-token`, `cat` on the missing path returned empty, an empty token means
# "act as the developer", and all three round notes posted under the DEVELOPER's
# identity while their footers claimed the QA agent. Author and reviewer became the
# same account — the property the split identity exists to prevent. Nothing errored;
# every post returned success. See docs/CASE-STUDIES.md §self-approval-fallback and
# its 2026-08-03 addendum.
#
# STILL OPEN after this emission is committed — the emission alone does not close it:
#
#  1. The seam should verify the token resolves to `expected_qa_user` before any
#     write. An empty token silently meaning "act as the developer" is what converts
#     each of these slips from an error into a misattribution. (An empty token is at
#     least LABELLED: forge_post_note marks such a note as automated review,
#     decided from the token it is sent rather than from QA_TOKEN_OK.)
#  2. Note-posting needs the same after-the-fact identity check that
#     references/approval.md prescribes for approvals: the API returns the created
#     note's `author.username`, so it is free. A footer asserting the identity is
#     written by the same session that got it wrong, and proves nothing.
# Serialized HERE, after every section that can append, and nowhere earlier: an
# append after the serialization point is silently absent from the JSON.
