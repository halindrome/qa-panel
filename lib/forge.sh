# forge.sh — the seam between this plugin and the code-review forge it talks to.
#
# Source this, call `forge_init <remote-url>`, then use the `forge_*` functions
# below. Exactly one backend (lib/forge-gitlab.sh or lib/forge-github.sh) is
# sourced by forge_init, chosen from the remote URL.
#
# "MR" throughout means "the change under review" — a GitLab merge request or a
# GitHub pull request. The vocabulary is GitLab's because that is where this
# implementation has the mileage; nothing about the seam is GitLab-specific.
#
# THE NORMALIZED SHAPE IS GITLAB'S. `forge_view_mr` must emit an object with
# these keys regardless of backend:
#
#   .title  .author.username  .source_branch  .target_branch
#   .state ("opened"|"merged"|"closed")  .draft (bool)
#   .changes_count (string)  .head_pipeline.status  .description
#
# That makes forge-gitlab.sh a near-passthrough and puts the whole mapping cost
# in forge-github.sh, which is the right place for it: GitLab is the shape the
# rest of this codebase was written against and re-normalizing both sides would
# be churn with no second consumer to justify it.
#
# EVERY FUNCTION REPORTS FAILURE. A backend call that cannot reach the forge
# returns non-zero and prints nothing to stdout. Callers must not treat empty
# output as "nothing found" — that conflation is the failure mode this whole
# codebase is built to avoid (an absent check must never report as a pass).
#
# CONTRACT — each backend defines:
#
#   forge_cli                                -> required CLI binary name
#   forge_auth_user            [token]       -> username of that identity
#   forge_project_enc          <slug>        -> the slug in API-path form
#   forge_view_mr              <dir> <n>     -> normalized JSON (see above)
#   forge_view_issue           <dir> <n>     -> {number,title,state,description,url}
#   forge_approvers            <slug> <n> [token] -> usernames, one per line
#   forge_notes                <slug> <n> [token] -> JSON array of {body: "..."}
#   forge_post_note            <slug> <n> <body-file> [token]
#   forge_approve              <slug> <n> [token]
#   forge_unapprove            <slug> <n> [token]
#
# Every one of those takes the PLAIN `owner/repo` slug, NOT the output of
# forge_project_enc. The API-path members encode internally; the members that
# shell out to `glab -R` / `gh -R` need the unencoded form and REJECT
# `owner%2Frepo`. This header said `<enc>` once and a caller who believed it hit
# `Expected the "[HOST/]OWNER/[NAMESPACE/]REPO" format`. forge_project_enc is
# exported for the skill's own raw `api` calls, not for these.
#
# forge_project_slug, forge_detect and _forge_require_token are shared and live here.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# forge_detect <remote-url> -> gitlab | github | unknown
#
# Host matching is a HEURISTIC and it fails on exactly the deployments that most
# need this to work: a self-hosted GitLab at git.example.com and a GitHub
# Enterprise instance both contain neither string. So an explicit answer always
# wins over sniffing —
#
#   $QA_FORGE (env)  >  the `forge` config key  >  the remote URL
#
# — set by the caller into QA_FORGE before calling. The env var is also the seam
# the test suite uses, since a fixture's remote is a local path with no host at
# all; that it doubles as the production escape hatch is the point, not a
# coincidence. A test-only seam nobody runs in anger is a seam that rots.
#
# Same host matching as lib/init.sh's detect_forge, deliberately: two detectors
# that can disagree is a bug waiting for a self-hosted instance to trigger it.

# forge_project_slug <remote-url> -> <group>[/<subgroup>...]/<project>
#
# Shared: the URL shapes (https, ssh, scp-style, SSH alias) are git's, not the
# forge's. Strip the parts rather than trying to capture the whole shape at
# once — a one-shot `s,^.*[/:]([^/]+/[^/]+)\.git$,\1,` had two defects: it
# required a literal `.git` suffix (a non-matching URL passed through UNCHANGED,
# so the full URL silently became the "project" and every later API call 404'd),
# and its fixed two-segment capture truncated nested subgroups (a/b/c -> b/c).
#
# Returns non-zero if the result is not a `<owner>/<repo>` path.

# _forge_require_token <caller> <token> -> 0 if non-empty, else 1 (and warns)
#
# An empty token makes `glab`/`gh` fall back to the DEFAULT (developer)
# identity. For forge_post_note that degradation is deliberate and documented:
# losing a round note entirely is worse than posting it under the developer's
# name, and _forge_note_body labels such a note as automated review. Degrading
# a note mislabels evidence; it still preserves it.
#
# For forge_approve / forge_unapprove the same fallback is NOT equivalent. On a
# self-authored MR it converts "QA has not approved" into "the author approved"
# — which satisfies an approvals check and enters the audit trail as review.
# That is strictly worse than no approval: degrading a note preserves
# information, degrading an approval FABRICATES it. It happened on this repo's
# first live cycle and nothing reported an error, because approving as the
# developer is a successful approve. See CASE-STUDIES.md §self-approval-fallback.
#
# So the asymmetry is the point. Do not "tidy" post_note into refusing, and do
# not tidy approve/unapprove into degrading.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
_forge_require_token() {
  [ -n "${2:-}" ] && return 0
  echo "error: $1 refused — no QA agent token. Approving with an empty token would act as the DEFAULT (developer) identity, which on a self-authored MR manufactures a self-approval that reads as review. Not calling the forge." >&2

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# _forge_note_body <file> <token> -> the note body to post
#
# With a token, the file unchanged. With an EMPTY token the note posts under
# the operator's own account, where a reader would take it for something the
# operator wrote — so it gets a banner saying an automated QA agent wrote it,
# directly under the leading heading (or at the top if there is none).
#
# Decided here, from the token actually being sent, because this is the one
# place every note passes through. A rule in the note template is applied by a
# model that may hold an empty token while believing it has the QA one; this
# cannot be. Idempotent: a body that already carries the banner is unchanged.
