#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-panel.sh — run the preflight-selected lens panel as `claude -p` subprocesses.
#
# Usage:  run-panel.sh <scratch-dir> [--skip-contract-verification]
# Exit:   0 every lens landed | 1 partial | 2 usage | 3 nothing landed | 5 internal
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The panel used to be fanned out by a model (agents/qa-manager.md
# §1): it resolved each lens's model, composed each prompt, named each output file,
# incremented a counter, and remembered which lenses failed. Every one of those was
# dropped at least once on a live round -- `"model": "sonnet"` invented against an
# explicit rule, SEVEN different names for one merged-findings file, a progress
# counter latched at `0/N` for the whole fan-out, a wedged lens detectable only by a
# stall heuristic. None of that is a comprehension failure that a louder instruction
# fixes; they are bookkeeping, and bookkeeping belongs in a script. So: the model is
# an ARGUMENT, the filenames belong to THIS file, the counter is written when a lens
# lands, a failed lens is a FILE ON DISK, and a wedged lens is a watchdog kill.
#
# WHY `claude -p` RATHER THAN Agent SUBAGENTS. Measured, not assumed
# (docs/ROADMAP.md "Phase 1 parity result"): on one recovered real lens prompt the
# `-p` arm produced 7 findings and 39 contract rows against the Agent arm's 3 and 24,
# actually CALLED the code-graph tools where the Agent lenses called them zero times,
# and ran in 1.39x the wall clock. It also gets three things the Agent path cannot:
# `--strict-mcp-config` makes the lens tool surface a property of this plugin instead
# of the operator's account; `--output-format json` reports the model that ACTUALLY
# ran; and a failed lens is an exit code instead of a thing to remember.
#
# THE ONE CRITERION THE PARITY GATE FAILED, AND WHAT FIXES IT. The `-p` arm returned
# a markdown round-note instead of lens JSON, because `--agent` loads
# agents/qa-reviewer.md whose `## Output Format` section prescribes markdown, and
# that SYSTEM prompt beat the USER prompt's request for JSON. The Agent path has the
# identical conflict and JSON merely happened to win -- so the format was never
# stable, it was a coin toss. `--json-schema` settles it: the schema is enforced by
# the runtime, not requested in prose. Probed against a system prompt that said
# "Never emit JSON" and the schema still won.
#
# NO RETRY. agents/qa-manager.md used to say "re-run once, then record it". A retry
# doubles the cost of the failure most likely to repeat -- a wedged lens burns the
# watchdog twice -- and it hides the failure from the round note, which is the one
# place an operator would see it. Re-running the round is a human's call. Every
# failure mode below is therefore terminal, distinguishable, and written down.
