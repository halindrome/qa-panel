# record-timing.sh — append one round's observed timing to a per-project history.
#
# Usage:  record-timing.sh <scratch-dir>
#
# WHAT IT RECORDS AND WHY THAT STATISTIC. The stall detector measures ONE thing:
# how long the round has gone without writing. So the number worth learning is not
# the average lens duration, it is the MAXIMUM GAP BETWEEN WRITES — the longest
# silence that was still healthy. Measured on a real round those differ sharply:
# six lenses ran ~11.5 minutes total, but produced a single 8m55s silence from
# fan-out to the first return and then finished within a 2m18s burst. An estimator
# built on mean duration would have set a fuse that fires during normal operation.
#
# This only OBSERVES. Nothing reads the history yet, deliberately: the current
# threshold is a constant someone guessed (twice, wrongly), and the honest fix is
# to collect real distributions per project before choosing an estimator, rather
# than inventing another multiplier on one data point.
