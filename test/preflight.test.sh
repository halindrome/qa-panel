# MUST be run with `bash` explicitly. The default interactive shell here is zsh,

# logic under zsh produces false results (that already caused one false negative
# while QA'ing this file's own MR).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DESIGN RULE — READ BEFORE ADDING A TEST
#
#   NEVER re-implement production logic inside this file and assert against the
#   copy. Drive the REAL preflight.sh and assert on what it emits.
#
# An earlier version of this suite defined its own `parse_url()` and its own
# `is_protected()` and tested those. It was 41/41 green while 7 of 8 deliberate
# breaks in the real script shipped undetected — reverting the real URL parser to
# its exact documented bug still passed. A test that asserts against a copy tests
# the copy. It is worse than no test, because it manufactures confidence.
#
# Every assertion below must be reachable from preflight.sh's real output:
#   - the URL parser        -> assert .gitlab_project
#   - is_protected          -> assert exit 4 on a protected source branch
#   - the SAST classifier   -> assert .sast.gate_state
#   - review_mode routing   -> assert .review_mode
# preflight.json IS still emitted on exit 3 and exit 4, so its fields remain
# assertable on the failure paths too.
#
# If you cannot observe a behaviour from the outside, that is a signal to give
# preflight a real seam — not a licence to test a copy.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Hermetic: no network, no live GitLab, no real pipeline, no read of the real QA
# token. Each case builds a throwaway repo with a real `origin` (a local bare
# repo) plus stub `glab`/helpers on PATH. GIT_SSH_COMMAND=false and .invalid
# hosts guarantee that the URL-parser cases fail fast without touching DNS.

# preflight resolves the repo root from git now, so it must be RUN FROM INSIDE the
# repo; the plugin lives outside that tree entirely. The subshell keeps the cd from
# leaking into the suite.
# HOME is overridden because preflight merges a USER config layer from
# $HOME/.config/qa-panel/config.json. Without this, a developer's real
# user config merges into every fixture and the suite is not hermetic: it would
# pass or fail differently on their machine than in CI.
#
# CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR must be pinned for the SAME reason and is NOT covered by HOME:
# the CMM/Context-Mode probe reads "${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.config/claude-code}",
# so an inherited CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR points the probe straight back at the developer's
# real plugin cache and `tooling.cmm_available` becomes a property of the machine
# running the suite. Pinning HOME alone left that hole open — verified, not assumed.
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT / CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR are unset for the same reason: the probe
# walks CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT up to a plugins/cache root, so an inherited value points
# it at the DEVELOPER'S real plugin cache. That is both a hermeticity leak and a
# performance cliff — a maxdepth-7 find over a populated cache, twice per run, on

# The stub is a fake `claude` on $PATH, one layer below the driver, for the same
# reason the forge cases stub `glab` rather than lib/forge.sh: stubbing anything
# higher would re-implement the driver's own logic in the test. Its success
# envelope is the SHAPE of a real `--output-format json` run recorded on
# 2026-09-04 (claude 2.1.260) — `modelUsage` with camelCase token keys,
# `structured_output` as an object, `stop_reason: tool_use` on a multi-turn run.
# Those three are exactly what the driver reads, and each was a guess before the
# run: a hand-invented envelope would have had snake_case, a string
# `structured_output`, and `end_turn`, and the driver would have passed its tests
# and failed in production on all three.

# The SAST helper gets an ABSOLUTE target path
#
# Reported from a live cycle: on every mobile MR the SAST step came back
# `skipped:helper-failed`. Preflight passed the target's RELATIVE path
# (`apps/mobile`) and the helper resolves it against its own cwd — which is
# wherever the operator invoked /qa-cycle, since preflight never cd's globally
# (every git call is `(cd "$TARGET_ABS" && …)` in a subshell). Start a session
# inside the submodule you are working on and the helper looks for
# `<submodule>/apps/mobile`, fails its `[ -d ]` check, and the round loses its
# SAST delta entirely.
#
# This fixture reproduces the MECHANISM (cwd is not the repo root) with a plain
# subdirectory rather than a real submodule. That is the whole of the bug —
# REPO_ROOT is already superproject-aware via --show-superproject-working-tree —
# but it does mean this case would not catch a future submodule-specific defect.
